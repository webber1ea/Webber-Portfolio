    <p>My name is Emily, I am 23 years old. I am a Sagittarius! I have a twin sister, Alex, she is a minute younger then me and I don't let her forget it! Alex and I are complete opposites! Currently, I am working at <a href="http://www.buddyspizza.com/">Buddy's Pizza</a> in Auburn Hills, feel free to check out the website!I am very interested in computers, when I was a kid I was always on the computer. I remember buying my own
      laptop and I was so excited. I also love playing video games too. I love animals! I have a dog named Bailey and kitten named Everest. I enjoy reading books!  Right now, I like reading poems and reading about Greek Mythology.  I also love watching good movies like Forrest Gump!   <div class="quote">
